# LP
This repository contains exercises and a project for the Programming Languages ([LP](https://www.fib.upc.edu/ca/estudis/graus/grau-en-enginyeria-informatica/pla-destudis/assignatures/LP)) course at FIB-UPC.

## Contents

- `TreballDirigit.pdf`: Project that briefly documents some of Java's characteristics.
- `MiniScheme`: [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) interpreter implemented in Python using an ANTLR4 grammar. See its README for details.
- `LAB`: Exercises in Haskell, Python, and ANTLR from the Jutge online judge platform.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following tools installed:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [ANTLR 4](https://www.antlr.org/)

### Œª Haskell

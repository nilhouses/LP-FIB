# LP
This repository contains exercises and a project for the Programming Languages (LP) course at FIB-UPC.

## Contents

- `TreballDirigit.pdf`: Project that briefly documents some Java characteristics
- `MiniScheme`: [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) interpreter coded in Python using Antlr4 grammar, its README explains further. 
- `LAB`: Haskell, Python and Antlr exercises from the [Jutge](https://jutge.org/) webpage.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following tools installed:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- [ANTLR 4](https://www.antlr.org/)

### Œª Haskell

 You can use [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to install Haskell components:

### üêç Python 

Install Python depending on your OS:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
  ```
- **Windows** Download the installer from python.org

### üì¶ Antlr4

After installing python, you can get [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/about.html), executing:
```bash
    pip install antlr4-tools
    antlr4
